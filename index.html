            <p>
                Hi! My name is Luis and I find enjoyment in learning, helping others grow, and actively exploring new things.
                My curiosity in software development began in 2015, when I accidently clicked on the terminal window on my friend's laptop.
                I had never owned a laptop but become so intriguied on what computers really are behind the scenes.<br>
                I began my journey into tech in 2020 when I received a promotion as an analyst, though no real tehcnical skills required, I
                decided to develop my skills to improve my current work, and help others with automation and analysis.<br>
                Fast forward to November 2021...I joined Coding Dojo's coding bootcamp to gain more knowledge and to keep learning. 
                Here I learned so much of what the tech world provides; from technology advancements, problem solving, learning tools to be
                better equipped in software, and the building 
                blocks of computer programming.<br>
                Currently I am challenging myself to become better than who I was yesterday(the small achievements really matter!), fusing my 
                knowledge in my current role, building personal projects, and decided to become a devoted long-term learner.
